# Google-Chrome-backup
One of my teachers lost years worth of Google Chrome bookmarks. Since I'm a bored nerd who doesn't like seeing people upset, I decided to write her a few scripts to help prevent this from happening in the future.

Currently, because these scripts are intended for use on her computer, they're written for a macOS enviornment. However, the only things stopping these scripts from working on a Linux enviornment, that I can see, are paths. Google Chrome data on Linux is not stored in ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/ and so on.
