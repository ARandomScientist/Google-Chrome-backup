# Google Chrome Backup
Ever lost everything? All of your bookmarks, saved logins, browsing history? I'm making this tool to help prevent that from happening again.

## Platforms
- macOS

## Development Progress
Both `backup-chrome.sh` and `restore-backup.sh` are reasonably safe and effective. `setup.sh`, on the other hand, is **not** complete enough to use. Beware.
