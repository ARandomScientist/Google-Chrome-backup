# Google-Chrome-backup
One of my teachers lost years worth of Google Chrome bookmarks. Since I'm a bored nerd who doesn't like seeing people upset, I decided to write her a few scripts to prevent help prevent it from happening in the future.

Currently, because this is intended for use on her computer, these scripts are written for a macOS enviornment.
