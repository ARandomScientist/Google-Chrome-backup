# Google Chrome Backup
One of my teachers lost years worth of Google Chrome bookmarks. Since I'm a bored nerd who doesn't like seeing people upset, I decided to write her a few scripts to help prevent this from happening in the future.

## Platforms
Currently, because these scripts are intended for use on her computer, they're written for a macOS environment. However, the only things stopping these scripts from working on a Linux environment, that I can see, are paths. Google Chrome data on Linux is not stored in ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/ and so on. I am a Linux nerd, though, so I may make a Linux port at some point.

## Documentation
There isn't any yet.
